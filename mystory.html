        <h5>Nov 13, 2023</h5>
        <p class="blogp">
            Playing in the mud, riding tractors and dirt bikes, playing video games, and being interested in just about anything related to 
            computers are all things you might expect of a little boy, but I wasn't a little boy. Growing up in a house full of "girly" girls, 
            I was definitely the odd one out. Everyone else thought I was just weird, or that it was all just a phase. And yet, my hobbies 
            continued well into adulthood and even led me toward a degree path and a dream of working in the technology field.
        </p>
        <p class="blogp">
            Being a woman working in the tech sector can be tricky to navigate. Working for a very male-dominated tech company, I have always 
            had to work harder to prove myself because my expertise is constantly questioned by clients and colleagues alike. On more than one 
            occasion, clients have outright asked to work with someone else because even before their issue was discussed, they were inexplicably 
            concerned that I might not know how to help them. I have even been passed over for promotions that I was objectively more qualified for. 
            While it would be dishonest to say it doesn't bother me, it's also much of what keeps driving me forward because, at the end of the day, 
            I still love what I do.
        </p>
        <p class="blogp"> 
            While I have certainly faced difficulty being a woman with passions in tech and gaming, I refuse to let that difficulty serve any purpose 
            but to strengthen my resolve to be the best I can at what I do. It's not just about proving misogynists wrong. It's about doing everything 
            I can to help make it so that little girls, like my niece, who has many of the same interests I do, don't have to feel like the odd one out. 
            One day, women will be able to work in any industry they choose without anyone unfairly questioning their ability, paying them less for their 
            work, or even harassing them. I absolutely love working with technology and playing video games, and if my work in those industries can help 
            that progress along a bit, all the better. Starting a masterâ€™s degree would only help me to come closer to achieving my dreams.
